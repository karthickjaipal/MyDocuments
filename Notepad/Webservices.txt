WebServices are subset of API's
WebServices are collection of Operations(resources)/methods


Soap WebServices follows some standard protocal called (SOAP Simple Object Access Protocal)
to send the request and receive the response

Interoperability issue : different platforms

Service should be up and running in web with some port :<WebService>

WSDl <WebService Description Language>


Contract of the WebService:<Service Description/ WSDL>

Is the WSDL file which comprises of all operations.
Each operations and its parameters

WSDL is a lengthy complicated XML Document with all operations and its parameters details:
- where the service is hosted
- operations which supports
- Parameters details : datatypes

wsdl definitions
wsdl messages
wsdl binding : number of operations it supports
- wsdl operations
wsdl service

its always we send soap messages<request> and we get soap messages<response>

- how to connect and make request                    - Communication protocal




Assertions in SOAP UI:

 1. Contains
 2. Not Contains
 3. Valid HTTP Response code
 4. Response SLA : Response time
 5. Soap Response : Response format
 6. Senstive information exposure : 
 7. Xpath match
 : value of the node (@particular node)
 : exists of node
 : number of occurence of node
 : Regular Expression using WildCards
 
 
 Restful WebServices:
 -------------------
 It is not a protocal , where it is a Rest Architecture
 We access all the resources of a WebService, by using standard HTTP Methods CRED
 
 GET Request: Parameters can be sent with the request
 POST Request: Parameters cant be sent with the request
 
 
 2 ways of Scripting- Soap UI:
 -----------------------
 1. Groovy scripting : xml responses automation
 2. Scripting Assertions: json and xml
